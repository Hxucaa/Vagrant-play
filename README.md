Running your existing app in Vagrant
===================
Store your existing app in a folder named `activator-project` as a sibling of the one containing the Vagrant files. `vagrant up` the box and `vagrant ssh` into it. Now you can `cd /activator-project/` and start it via `activator run`.

You might have to restart vagrant box before running your app the first time, if the activator hangs on installing sbt.
